# Introduction

This repository is hosting the R code for the assignment of the DataScience track's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the collection, work with, and cleaning of this data set. Tidy data have been prepared so can be used for later analysis.


# Data Set

The original data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" has been taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.


# Execution and files

The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.

The run_analysis.R is the script file used for this work. It can be executed as-is. The script file will download the source dataset file from the internet and perform the analysis required.

The result of the execution is 'tidy.txt' file, that stores mean and standard deviation of each measurement per activity&subject for later analysis.
